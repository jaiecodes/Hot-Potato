What project you want to do?
  I want my project to be an interactive dating sim. They project will be similar to the JSON adventure project where I will use JSON files to store the characters and their dialogue options. The game will use Cinder's 2D Graphics and Image features to display the menu, diagloue boxes, and characters. I want the game to have at least 3-5 potential partners that will take you on daily dates. With the main mechanic being able to increase your love rating with a partner through the date's diagloue. The goal of the game will be reach max love rating with your partner of chose. 

What background knowledge do you have on this kind of project, and why do you want to do this project? 
  As mention before, background knowledge in JSON files, serialization, deserialization, and Cinder App development will be useful for this project's sucess. The multi-disciplinary apect of creating an dating sim game seems engaging because of my interests in design, story telling, and interactive programs. Furthermore, I feel like dating sims have the potential to be humorous and it would be interesting to take an established genre and put my own twist and ideas into it.

  * Week 1:
  * Implement serialization and deserilaization functions
  * Write Dialogue/Stoarbroad

If you were to finish the project early, what extra "stretch goals" could you implement?
  If I had extra time I would create my own artwork, and also maybe add an item/gift mechanic.
